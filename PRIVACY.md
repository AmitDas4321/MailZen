# Privacy Policy for MailZen

*Last updated: October 2025*

## 1. Introduction

MailZen (“the Extension”) is developed and maintained by [Amit Das](https://amitdas.site).
This Privacy Policy explains how MailZen handles user data while you use the extension available on the Chrome Web Store.

By installing or using MailZen, you agree to the practices described below.

---

## 2. Data Collection

MailZen **does not collect, transmit, or sell any personally identifiable information (PII)**.

The extension operates entirely within your browser and **never sends your email content, contacts, or browsing data** to any external servers.

---

## 3. Data Storage

MailZen uses the **Chrome `storage` API** to store the following items **locally on your device**:

* User preferences and editor settings (such as last-used HTML templates)
* Optional UI preferences (theme, layout, etc.)

All data remains **on your computer only** and is **not shared** with anyone.

---

## 4. Permissions Explanation

### a. `storage`

Used to save editor preferences and HTML templates locally to improve user experience.

### b. `tabs`

Used to open the welcome/uninstall pages and to identify the active mail compose tab for inserting HTML content.
MailZen does **not** read your browsing history or access other websites.

### c. `management`

Used only to ensure uninstall feedback is shown properly and to verify the extension’s own installation status.
It does **not** view, modify, or control other extensions.

### d. Host Permissions

```
https://mail.google.com/*
https://inbox.google.com/*
https://mail.yahoo.com/*
https://*.mail.yahoo.com/*
https://outlook.live.com/*
https://outlook.office.com/*
```

These permissions allow MailZen to function **only** inside Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Outlook Web interfaces so you can insert HTML code directly into the compose window.
No other sites are accessed or modified.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

MailZen does **not** use analytics tools, external servers, or third-party APIs.
All operations occur locally within the user’s browser.

---

## 6. Data Security

Because no personal data is transmitted or stored externally, there is **minimal risk of data exposure**.
However, users are encouraged to keep their browsers updated for the latest security patches.

---

## 7. User Control

Users can delete all locally stored data anytime by:

1. Removing the extension from Chrome; and/or
2. Clearing browser storage via **chrome://settings/clearBrowserData**

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

Any future updates to this Privacy Policy will be published at the same GitHub URL.
Users are encouraged to review it periodically.
